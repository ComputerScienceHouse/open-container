# open-container

open-container is a ride-board application written in Python+Flask with a
frontend using Jinja2 and
[CSH Flavored Bootstrap](https://github.com/bencentra/bootstrap-csh).

Open Container is a replacement for
[kdolan/ride](https://github.com/kdolan/ride), that provides an HTTP API for
accessing and mutating ride-board data. Through working on this project I've
remembered quite a few of the reasons that deter me from wanting to work on
frontend web development. I struggled with the concept of getting a working UI
and UX flow across multiple pages and spent a few days trying for the opposite.
After realizing that a single-page dynamic site wasn't in the scope of my design
abilities I went back to seperating out different actions into their own pages.

There are sill a few things that I believe would be beneficial to
open-container, but in no way are they necessary for it to be used in place of
ride. As someone who's a supporter of FOSS I want to leave these
low-hanging-fruit open to potential contributors who may be interested in using
open-container as a base to sharpen their design or development skills in the
future. You can see a list of some of my potential ideas on the issues page.
